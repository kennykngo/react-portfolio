# My Portfolio Site!

## Description

My portfolio site created using mainly ReactJS and SASS. Of course, there are inclusions of hooks, states, and even dark mode. This site was designed and coded by Kenny Ngo and I'm rather proud of this, but I will always further continue to update/upgrade my portfolio!

## Installation
